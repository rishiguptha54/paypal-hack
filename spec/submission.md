### Employer / IP check (do this first — 27 Oct)

The rules require the submission to be **solely owned by the entrants** and not to infringe anyone else's rights. If any member is employed, check the employer's policy on outside projects, hackathons and IP before building.
- Build on **personal** devices and accounts (personal GitHub, personal PayPal developer, personal AI/Channel3/Render accounts).
- Keep project files out of corporate storage (e.g., company OneDrive) and corporate repos.
- Don't use employer confidential information, code or paid tool licenses unless the employer allows it.
- This is a checklist, not legal advice; ask your employer's policy owner if unsure.

## 3. Prize strategy

Allowed: at most **one Grand Prize or one Honorable Mention**, plus **one Sponsor Prize**.

| Track | Fit | What wins it (from the official criteria / sponsor pages) | Our proof point |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grand Prize (1st–3rd) | Primary | Strong across all five criteria; tie-break order is Tech Implementation → Design → Impact → Innovation → Presentation | Real PayPal flow with a pre-capture verification gate; complete UX |
| Best Use of Agentic Commerce | Strong | "Agents that … actually transact" (resources page) | The agent finds, evaluates and pays — inside a mandate the user locked |
| Best Use of PayPal + AI | Strong | Deep use of PayPal **and** AI | LLM mandate + PayPal-verified capture + AI governance dashboard |
| **Sponsor: Best Use of AG Grid** (primary sponsor) | Needs AG Studio | Sponsor page asks for **AG Studio** polish: **custom widgets, theming, layout tools** — "not just AG Grid or AG Charts on their own" — and the **Studio Agent Framework** | "Spend Governance Studio": themed AG Studio dashboard, custom *Mandate Integrity* widget, custom agent via `clientToolRunner` (see [architecture.md §17](architecture.md#17-governance-studio-ag-studio)) |
| Sponsor: Best Use of Channel3 (fallback sponsor) | Already core | API or MCP used as a **meaningful** part of the product; calling it is required | Live search feeding the policy engine |

**Decision:** AG Grid (AG Studio) is the main sponsor target. If the AG Studio work misses Gate 2 (6 Nov), switch the sponsor pitch to **Channel3** — no code change needed. Render and Postman are used for delivery quality, not for prizes.

## 4. Devpost submission content

### 4.1 Fields

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Project name | IntentLock |
| Tagline (≤ 200 chars) | "An AI shopping agent that can only buy what you approved — every PayPal capture is checked against your locked purchase mandate." |
| Built with (tags) | `paypal`, `paypal-orders-api`, `paypal-js-sdk-v6`, `typescript`, `react`, `node.js`, `express`, `postgresql`, `zod`, `<ai-provider>`, `channel3`, `ag-grid`, `ag-studio`, `render`, `postman`, `playwright` |
| Try it out links | Hosted URL · GitHub repo · Postman collection |
| Video | YouTube (public) |
| Image gallery (5–7 images, 3:2) | 1 hero (flow diagram) · 2 mandate editor · 3 offers with block reasons · 4 PayPal sandbox approval · 5 capture-gate rejection (tamper) · 6 Governance Studio dashboard · 7 Intent Receipt with chain INTACT |

### 4.2 Story outline (Devpost's standard sections)

| Section | Content (keep each to 3–6 sentences; facts only) |
|---|---|
| Inspiration | AI agents can shop, but a recommendation isn't an authorization. Small-business owners need to hand off routine buying without losing control of spend. |
| What it does | The five-step flow; the three outcomes (allow / block / review); the PayPal-verified capture gate; the receipt and dashboard. |
| How we built it | Architecture diagram; LLM only drafts; pure rules engine; mandate hash; Orders v2 + `PayPal-Request-Id`; JS SDK v6; Channel3 search; AG Studio + agent; Postgres CAS state machine; Render. |
| Challenges | E.g., making capture idempotent under retries; recurrence detection without a provider field; keeping the AI away from payment authority. **Write only what actually happened.** |
| Accomplishments | Measured results from CI (actual test counts), tamper/replay scenarios blocked on camera. |
| What we learned | Real learnings only. |
| What's next | Wrap PayPal Agent Toolkit / MCP tools behind the IntentLock gate; multi-currency; team approval chains. |

### 4.3 "Tools" field (required)

| Tool | Type | How it is used |
|---|---|---|
| `<LLM provider + model>` | AI model | Turns the buyer's request into a schema-validated draft mandate (structured JSON output). It never sees product data and cannot approve or pay. |
| `<same or other model>` via AG Studio Agent Framework | AI agent | Answers governance questions ("why were offers blocked this week?") by building dashboard widgets from the session's audit data. Read-only. |
| PayPal Orders v2 + JS SDK v6 (Sandbox) | Payments | Create order, buyer approval, server-side verify + capture, webhooks |
| Channel3 Search API | Product data | Live product offers for the policy engine |
| AG Grid / AG Studio | UI | Audit ledger and governance dashboard |
| Render | Hosting | Web service + Postgres |
| GitHub Copilot | Dev tool | Coding assistant (named for transparency) |

## 5. Judge access (goes in README and Devpost "testing instructions")

- **Hosted demo:** URL, no login. Sessions are anonymous and isolated.
- **PayPal sandbox buyer:** email + password of a **dedicated sandbox personal account** made only for judges. Never share the sandbox **business** account or the REST app secret.
- **Optional card path:** PayPal sandbox card generator link, for judges who can't log in.
- **Run locally:** judges create their own free PayPal sandbox app (≈ 5 min, link to steps), Channel3 key (free; promo `PAYPAL-HACKATHON-2026` gives 20 000 credits) and an AI key. Fixture mode (`PRODUCT_SOURCE=fixture`) needs no Channel3 key. State clearly that the LLM is required for the AI features.
- **Known-good scenario:** "Buy 2 ergonomic office chairs, max $400 total, only from acme-office.example or deskworks.example, no subscriptions."
- **Expected results table:** which offer is allowed or blocked, and why. Judges can check behavior quickly.

## 6. Video production checklist

- [ ] Script timed ≤ 2:50 ([plan.md §7](plan.md#7-demo-video-script-under-3-minutes)); open with the problem and the user within 15 s.
- [ ] Record at 1080p; browser zoom 110–125 %; hide bookmarks, extensions, other tabs, notifications.
- [ ] Show the **real** hosted app and a **real** sandbox capture; on-screen label "PayPal Sandbox — test money".
- [ ] No secrets on screen (devtools network panel filtered; no `.env`; no dashboard pages with keys).
- [ ] No copyrighted music; no third-party logos other than the sponsor tools actually used.
- [ ] Burned-in or YouTube captions (accessibility + clarity for judges).
- [ ] Upload as **Public** (not unlisted); confirm it plays while logged out.
- [ ] **Backup cut recorded at Gate 2 (6 Nov)** so a late regression can't leave us without a video.

## 7. Judging-period runbook (1–15 Dec)

| Item | Action |
|---|---|
| Hosting | Render web service on a **paid** instance (free tier sleeps after 15 min idle and takes ~1 min to wake) — paid with the hackathon's Render credit offer. |
| Database | **Paid** Render Postgres. Free Postgres **expires 30 days after creation** — a DB created on 3 Nov would expire on 3 Dec, in the middle of judging. |
| AG Studio license | AG Grid offers a **45-day trial**. Activate it **on or after 1 Nov** so it covers 15 Dec; note the expiry date in the README. |
| Uptime | External uptime monitor on `/api/health` every 5 min, with alerts to two team members. |
| Cost control | Set a hard spend limit / budget alert on the AI provider; keep per-session rate limits on. |
| Keys | Don't rotate keys or change sandbox passwords until after 21 Dec. |
| Code freeze | Tag `v1.0.0-submission`; Devpost links to that tag. After the deadline, keep `main` at the tag; do further work on a branch. Rules forbid changing the submission after the deadline. |
| Seed data | Daily check that the demo scenario still gives the expected results (Channel3 data can change → fixture mode switch documented). |

## 8. Third-party license register (`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`)

| Component | License / terms | Note |
|---|---|---|
| PayPal SDKs/APIs | PayPal Developer Agreement | Sandbox only |
| Channel3 API | Channel3 terms | Show data, not retailer logos |
| AG Grid Community | MIT | Ledger |
| AG Studio | Commercial **trial** license | Key loaded from env at build/runtime, not committed. Without a key the app still works, but AG Studio shows a trial watermark. Mention this in the README. |
| LLM provider | Provider API terms | No user PII sent |
| npm dependencies | Generated list (`license-checker --summary`) | Fail CI on GPL/AGPL in runtime deps |

## 9. Community and support

- Join the **PayPal hackathon Discord** (sponsor channels for AG Grid, Channel3, Render). Ask sponsor questions there early (by 28 Oct), e.g. AG Studio trial for a public repo, or Channel3 docs access.
- Webinars (recordings on the [resources page](https://paypalaihackathon.devpost.com/resources)): "Start building with PayPal" and "Build a payments dashboard without building a dashboard" (AG Grid) — watch both before Phase 1 and the AG Studio work.
